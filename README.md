# C-WPF-RPG
Three things I'm trying to approach with this execution:

1.Learn the fundamentals of programming in C#, I will be using a tool called
WPF(to use good programming practices)
2.Use an edited "live-stream" format, to see how a programmer thinks and works 
when creating a program.
3.Create an open-source RPG engine that can be easily enchanced and modified.
