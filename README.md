# C-WPF-RPG
Three things I'm trying to approach with this execution:

<ol>
<li>Learn the fundamentals of programming in C#, I will be using a tool called WPF(to use good programming practices)</li>
<li>Use an edited "live-stream" format, to see how a programmer thinks and works when creating a program.</li>
<li>Create an open-source RPG engine that can be easily enchanced and modified.</li>
</ol>

All the credits of this tutorial I will be following are in the following 
link: https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/ , Note that all the credits go
to they accordingly, I was not involved in the making of such tutorial.

Features of the game

These are the things I want the player to be able to do in the game.

First version

<ol>
  <li>User can create a player</li>
  <li>Different classes (different bonuses for each class)</li>
  <li>Player can move to locations</li>
  <li>The location might have a monster to fight</li>
  <li>If the player defeats the monster, they receive:</br>
-Experience points, gold, random loot</br>
-If the player loses to the monster, they: return to home and their health is restored</br></li>
  
  <li>The location might have a quest</li>
  <li>Completing the quest requires turning in an item</li>
  <li>Item is from monster loot</li>
  <li>When the player has the quest completion item, and returns to the location where they received the quest, they receive:</li>
  <li>Player can buy/sell items</li>
