# C-WPF-RPG
Three things I'm trying to approach with this execution:

>1.Learn the fundamentals of programming in C#, I will be using a tool called WPF(to use good programming practices)
>2.Use an edited "live-stream" format, to see how a programmer thinks and works when creating a program.
>3.Create an open-source RPG engine that can be easily enchanced and modified.

Features of the game

These are the things I want the player to be able to do in the game.

First version

*User can create a player
*Different classes (different bonuses for each class)
*Player can move to locations
*The location might have a monster to fight
*If the player defeats the monster, they receive:
>Experience points, gold, random loot
>If the player loses to the monster, they:
>
>>Return home
>>Are completely healed
>
**The location might have a quest
**Completing the quest requires turning in an item
**Item is from monster loot
**When the player has the quest completion item, and returns to the location where they received the quest, they receive:
**Experience points, gold, a reward item
**The location might have a trader
**Player can buy/sell items
**Player can save/load game
